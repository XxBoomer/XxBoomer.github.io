                        <span style="font-size: 25px">Hi !</span> My name is _______________.
                        I came from a small town located in south-east of Vietnam and I migrated to the United State in 7th grade with my family.
                        Because of the language barrier, video games is my only escape at the time.
                        Like most people, I play a lot of video games in my middle and high school years.
                        What different is that I am a very competitive gamer, I would spent hours trying to be the top players,
                        but the games that I used to play was very time consuming so I wanted to find a way to do more for less.
                        Then I discovered <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">Autohotkey</a> (a scripting language that let you manipulate keystrokes and mouse)
                        and I started making tools to boost my gaming experience and share it to other players. Since that day, I dedicated my time to make more tools for not just gaming, but also tools to helps with my daily tasks.
